# Internet-Speedtest-Scraper

### Built using Python (Selenium, SMTP, Time)

## Description
This small project creates a bot using Selenium to run an internet
speedtest and retrieve your upload and download speed. Depending on
the results and your set minimum speeds, an email will be sent to you
that will notify you about the slow speeds.

As it was a relatively simple project using Python, Selenium, SMTP, and
the Time module, I also went with some OOP Principles, such as adding
abstraction through private methods that are only accessed on the class level.
